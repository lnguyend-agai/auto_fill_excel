# Auto Fill Excel

# Introduction
At lunch, I usually share a menu of dishes with my colleagues so they can place their orders. However, manually reading each message, listing food names and quantities, and then filling in an Excel file to track payments takes a lot of time.

To solve this, I created Auto Fill Excel – a tool to automate this process.
# Features

✅ Summarizing Orders from Messages
Simply copy all messages from Teams and paste them into the tool.
The tool will automatically extract food names and quantities.
A summary visualization will be displayed as an image.

✅ Filling Orders into Excel
The app will match names from Teams with the Excel file.
It will find the correct date and fill in the corresponding price for each person.
